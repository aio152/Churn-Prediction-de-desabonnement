Churn classification aims to predict whether a customer will stop using the service or the company. This is a critical issue, particularly in sectors where customer retention is essential, such as telecommunications, online subscriptions, or financial services. The ability to anticipate customer churn allows companies to implement proactive retention strategies, thereby reducing revenue loss.Acquiring new customers is generally more expensive than retaining and building loyalty with existing ones.

In this context, we have a dataset from a fictitious telecommunications company. The goal is to analyze this data and develop a machine learning model capable of predicting when a customer is about to churn.
